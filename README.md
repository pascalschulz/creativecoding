# creativecoding
This is a collection of all creative code that I have created over the years. 

All code builds on the outstanding [p5.js library](https://p5js.org/). Make sure to check out their excellent ["Get Started" page](https://p5js.org/get-started/) before you dig into creating your own art. 

All Javascript code to recreate the images in the [PNGs](/PNGs) folder can be found in the [JS](/JS) folder. All JS and PNG files that belong together, do have the same name. 

### How to run the examples

Download the [p5.js complete package](https://p5js.org/download/). You can use the [index.html](/index.html) to run the scripts in your browser. I have tested all my scripts in Firefox, which worked out nicely. Make sure to put the code out of the [JS folder](/JS) into the "sketch.js" file.
